- [] Adjust plague doc so it clones the number of enemies instead of adding more sprites into the hierarchy?
- [] Fix game over triggered by plague doc (when there's multiple of them), because currently they will contintue attacking
- [] Fix boss level UI health bar not showing up on screen
- [] Add a "new game" button
- [] Add ambient sound effects to levels
- [] Add win sound effects
- [] Maybe add button sound effects
- [] Add loot appear sound effects, screen shake, and loot should fade in
- [] After loot appears, change music to be tenser, and maybe increase the speed of game/enemies
- [] Additional death screen effect maybe
- [] Make the map so it shows which levels were completed, also take build index off of map?
